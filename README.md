AnagrammatistJS
=============

Anagrammatist is a simple tool to assist in coming up with
subversive slogans for replacing messages on marquee signs.
It is intended for finding amusing rearrangements of letters,
given a finite number of initial letters.

This is a JavaScript rewrite of my previous desktop version,
[written in python](https://github.com/jperryhouts/anagrammatist).
